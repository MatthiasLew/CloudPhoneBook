# CloudPhoneBook
CloudPhoneBook is an improved version of a legacy console-based phone book project (C, MySQL, 2024), rebuilt as a modern desktop application using Qt (PySide6), FastAPI and PostgreSQL (Supabase). It supports secure login, cloud-based contact storage and synchronized UI settings across devices.
